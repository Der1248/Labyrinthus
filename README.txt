Thanks to:

SnikeMK for many nice textures

Info:
Labyrinthus is a puzzle game in minetest.
Can you help the nyancat to find her rainbow block??
But first you have to solve puzzles to color the rainbow block.
Use your Up, Down, Right, Left key to control the cat 
and if you jump the cat will throw a ball. (if you have one)
Use the sneak key to restart a level.
Over 50 blocks with differend functions to solve more than 520 puzzles.
